    <title lang="en">Escape From Alcatraz (1979)</title>
    <desc lang="en">Clint Eastwood stars in; Dirty Harry director Don Siegel's prison break classic, which is based on a real-life attempt to do what was supposed to be impossible: escape from Alcatraz, the notorious island penitentiary off the Californian coast. Frank Morris (Eastwood) has been transferred to Alcatraz after persistently making attempts to escape from mainland jails. Officials believe that, on The Rock, he'll cause them no further grief while serving his life sentence. But, constantly harassed by the prison warden and fellow convicts, Morris has other ideas. He shares his plans with three other prisoners - Clarence and John Anglin and Charley Butts - and together they gradually set about making their strike for freedom... The director ditches the standard prison-break flick's obsession with action for a more considered, suspenseful focus on the why and how of their bid</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Drew Barrymore enchants as a Chicago newspaper editor who relives her hellish teen years while on an undercover assignment at a local high school. Barrymore's great, but the film celebrates the fact that her character wins over the same type of “in crowd” that taunted her as a teen. David Arquette costars as her cool brother. Raja Gosnell is the director, and Barrymore served as executive producer</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work</desc>

    <title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2004) Lindsay Lohan stars as Cady Heron who, having been home-schooled by her parents, is new to high school and totally unversed on how to survive the jungle-like teen society. But, befriended by two other outsiders, goth Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and gay Damian (Daniel Franzese), she infiltrates queen bee Regina George's (Rachel McAdams) hive to bring about her downfall. Mark (Freaky Friday) Waters's teen comedy is a cut above the rest, thanks to a smart screenplay from Saturday Night Live regular Tina Fey (based on Rosalind Wiseman's non-fiction survival guide for young girls, Queen Bees and Wannabees ) and outstanding performances not just from Lohan, but the whole cast (watch out for Tim Meadows as the scene-stealing Principal Duvall).

    <title lang="en">Get Him to the Greek (2010)</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2010) Russell Brand and Jonah Hill star in Nicholas Stoller's boisterous comedy. Aaron Green (Hill) works for a record company run by the increasingly unhinged Sergio (Sean Combs) and is a huge fan of the British rock star Aldous Snow (Brand, reprising his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Sergio and Green hatch a plan for Snow to play, in just three days' time, Los Angeles's revered venue the Greek Theatre. Getting Snow from London to LA, via New York and Vegas, should be a doddle. But he's just fallen off the wagon, and the sleazy rocker's appetite for drink, drugs and attractive women complicate the journey so much that it's not clear whether Green will survive the rock star's hedonism. In addition to Combs' superbly energetic turn, Rose Byrne shines as Jackie Q, a role that satirises the record industry's fondness for marketing its female artists as sexual commodities. Also starring Elisabeth Moss, Colm Meaney and a host of real-life music icons</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shaun of the Dead (2004)</title>
    <desc lang="en">The combination of romance and zombies comedy seems unfeasible... unless it falls into the hands of the brilliant Edgar Wright, co-creator with Simon Pegg (scriptwriter of Zombies Party) of the Spaced series, a milestone in recent British television. In this macabre story, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is down in the dumps, going through an unstoppable crisis in his life. About to turn 30, he passes the time in The Winchester bar, dislikes his job, argues with his mother every day, and the relationship with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), worsens by the hour. When she finally leaves him, Shaun decides, once and for all, to do something about his life. His first step is not visiting a psychologist, but confronting an invasion of living dead with just two weapons: a cricket bat and a shovel! Zombies Party is -at the same time- a parody and a tribute to zombie films</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2005) Showing for the first time on More4, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two young cowboys paired up for a job tending sheep on a Wyoming mountain. As the days go by, their relationship develops until, after a heavy night drinking whisky, they make passionate love. Initially denying the attraction each feels for the other, they go their separate ways at the end of the job. Both marry and have children but meet regularly to ignite their undying passion for each other, living desperate, unfulfilled lives between each meeting until the untimely death of one leaves the other broken and devastated. Ang Lee's Oscar-winning drama is a bold, emotional story of a passion that cannot be denied but must be hidden from a world that can only condemn it. Premiere</desc>

    <title lang="en">Brokeback Mountain (2005)</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2005) Showing for the first time on More4, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two young cowboys paired up for a job tending sheep on a Wyoming mountain. As the days go by, their relationship develops until, after a heavy night drinking whisky, they make passionate love. Initially denying the attraction each feels for the other, they go their separate ways at the end of the job. Both marry and have children but meet regularly to ignite their undying passion for each other, living desperate, unfulfilled lives between each meeting until the untimely death of one leaves the other broken and devastated. Ang Lee's Oscar-winning drama is a bold, emotional story of a passion that cannot be denied but must be hidden from a world that can only condemn it. Premiere</desc>
